	# Should we pass handlers from the parent? {} - empty right now.
	# Add a new parameter in CreateBrowser() called "popupsInheritHandlers"?
	# Or maybe just an another dict "popupHandlers"? User could pass the same
	# handlers dictionary to both parameters.

	# What about popups created by popups? How do we do the inheritance in this case?
