# Browser (object)

The methods of this object may be called on any thread unless otherwise
indicated in the comments.

Remember to free all browser references when closing app
for the browser to shut down cleanly.
Otherwise data such as cookies or other storage might not be flushed to disk
when closing app, and other issues might occur as well. To free a reference
just assign a None value to a browser variable.

To compare browser objects always use [GetIdentifier()](#getidentifier)
method. Do not compare two Browser objects variables directly.

## Notes

Methods available in upstream CEF which were not yet exposed in CEF Python
(see src/include/cef_browser.h):

* ImeSetComposition
* ImeCommitText
* ImeFinishComposingText
* ImeCancelComposition

There are some edge cases when after the OnBeforeClose event browser objects
are no more globally referenced thus a new instance is created that
wraps upstream CefBrowser object. Browser objects that were globally
unreferenced do not have properties of the original Browser object,
for example they do not have client callbacks, javascript bindings
or user data set.

## Methods


### AddWordToDictionary

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| word | string |
| __Return__ | void |

Add the specified |word| to the spelling dictionary.


### CanGoBack

| | |
| --- | --- |
| __Return__ | bool |

Returns true if the browser can navigate backwards.


### CanGoForward

| | |
| --- | --- |
| __Return__ | bool |

Returns true if the browser can navigate forwards.


### CloseBrowser

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| forceClose | bool |
| __Return__ | void |

Closes the browser. If the window was created explicitily by you (not a popup) you still need to post WM_DESTROY message to the window.

Request that the browser close. The Javascript 'onbeforeunload' event will
be fired. If |force_close| is false the event handler, if any, will be
allowed to prompt the user and the user can optionally cancel the close.
If |force_close| is true the prompt will not be displayed and the close
will proceed. Results in a call to LifespanHandler::DoClose() if the
event handler allows the close or if |force_close| is true. See
LifespanHandler::DoClose() documentation for additional usage
information.


### CloseDevTools

| | |
| --- | --- |

> CefRenderHandler::StartDragging).
> This method is only used when window rendering is disabled.


### DragTargetDragOver

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| x | int |
| y | int |
| allowed_ops | int |
| __Return__ | void |

Description from upstream CEF:
> Call this method each time the mouse is moved across the web view during

| x | int |
| y | int |
| __Return__ | void |

Description from upstream CEF:
> Call this method when the user completes the drag operation by dropping
> the object onto the web view (after calling DragTargetDragEnter).
> The object being dropped is |drag_data|, given as an argument to

| operation | int |
| __Return__ | void |

Description from upstream CEF:
> Call this method when the drag operation started by a
> CefRenderHandler::StartDragging call has ended either in a drop or
> by being cancelled. |x| and |y| are mouse coordinates relative to the
> upper-left corner of the view. If the web view is both the drag source
> and the drag target then all DragTarget* methods should be called before
> DragSource* mthods.
> This method is only used when window rendering is disabled.

Operation enum from upstream CEF - these constants are declared in the
`cefpython` module:
> DRAG_OPERATION_NONE    = 0,
> DRAG_OPERATION_COPY    = 1,
> DRAG_OPERATION_LINK    = 2,
> DRAG_OPERATION_GENERIC = 4,

Description from upstream CEF:
> Call this method when the drag operation started by a
> CefRenderHandler::StartDragging call has completed. This method may be
> called immediately without first calling DragSourceEndedAt to cancel a
> drag operation. If the web view is both the drag source and the drag
> target then all DragTarget* methods should be called before DragSource*
> mthods.
> This method is only used when window rendering is disabled.


### ExecuteFunction

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| funcName | string |
| [params..] | mixed |
| __Return__ | void |

Call javascript function asynchronously. This can also call object's methods, just pass "object.method" as `funcName`. Any valid javascript syntax is allowed as `funcName`, you could even pass an anonymous function here.

For a list of allowed types for `mixed` see [JavascriptBindings](JavascriptBindings.md).IsValueAllowed() (except function, method and instance).

Passing a python function here is not allowed, it is only possible through [JavascriptCallback](JavascriptCallback.md) object.


### ExecuteJavascript

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| jsCode | string |
| scriptUrl="" | string |
| startLine=1 | int |
| __Return__ | void |

Execute a string of JavaScript code in this frame. The `scriptURL` parameter is the URL where the script in question can be found, if any. The renderer may request this URL to show the developer the source of the error.  The `startLine` parameter is the base line number to use for error reporting.

This function executes asynchronously so there is no way to get the returned value.

Calling javascript from native code synchronously is not possible in CEF 3. It is also not possible doing it synchronously the other way around ie. js->native.


### Find

> older requests. If |identifier| is zero or less than the previous ID value
> then it will be automatically assigned a new valid ID. |forward| indicates
> whether to search forward or backward within the page. |matchCase|
> indicates whether the search should be case-sensitive. |findNext| indicates
> whether this is the first request or a follow-up. The CefFindHandler
> instance, if any, returned via CefClient::GetFindHandler will be called to
> report find results.

- STATE_DEFAULT
- STATE_ENABLED
- STATE_DISABLED

Description from upstream CEF:
> Set accessibility state for all frames. |accessibility_state| may be
> default, enabled or disabled. If |accessibility_state| is STATE_DEFAULT
> then accessibility will be disabled by default and the state may be further
> controlled with the "force-renderer-accessibility" and
> "disable-renderer-accessibility" command-line switches. If
> |accessibility_state| is STATE_ENABLED then accessibility will be enabled.
> If |accessibility_state| is STATE_DISABLED then accessibility will be
> completely disabled.
>
> For windowed browsers accessibility will be enabled in Complete mode (which
> corresponds to kAccessibilityModeComplete in Chromium). In this mode all
> platform accessibility objects will be created and managed by Chromium's
> internal implementation. The client needs only to detect the screen reader
> and call this method appropriately. For example, on macOS the client can
> handle the @"AXEnhancedUserInterface" accessibility attribute to detect
> VoiceOver state changes and on Windows the client can handle WM_GETOBJECT
> with OBJID_CLIENT to detect accessibility readers.
>
> For windowless browsers accessibility will be enabled in TreeOnly mode
> (which corresponds to kAccessibilityModeWebContentsOnly in Chromium). In
> this mode renderer accessibility is enabled, the full tree is computed, and
> events are passed to CefAccessibiltyHandler, but platform accessibility
> objects are not created. The client may implement platform accessibility
> objects using CefAccessibiltyHandler callbacks if desired.

### SetClientCallback

| __Return__ | void |

Open developer tools (DevTools) in its own browser. The DevTools browser
will remain associated with this browser. If the DevTools browser is
already open then it will be focused, in which case the |windowInfo|,
|client| and |settings| parameters will be ignored. If |inspect_element_at|
is non-empty then the element at the specified (x,y) location will be
